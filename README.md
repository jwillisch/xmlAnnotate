Introducing xmlAnnotate

xmlAnnotate is a simple program that helps researchers transfer their human-labeled xml annotations into a file more conducive for machine learning and data analysis. 

XML annotate provides a function to automate data extraction from text annotations contained in multiple or single .xml files. 

It returns a data frame containing a unique sentence id, the sentence number, the topic or annotation code of the sentence, the word that triggered the annotation as well as the position of the sentence and any notes that the annotator made. 

xmlAnnotate It was originally created to work with the lightweight, general-purpose natural language annotation tool MAE. 

MAE allows users to define their own annotation tasks, mark up arbitrary text spans, use non-consuming tags, easily create links between annotations, and it outputs annotations in stand-off XML.
