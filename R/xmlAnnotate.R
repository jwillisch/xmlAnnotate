#' xmlAnnotate: A package for extracting annotations.
#'
#' the xmlAnnotate package contains three functions: \code{get_tagset} for extracting
#' tagset information from an XML output file in a rather particular format,
#' \code{get_tagsets} which applies this to lots of such files and concatenates the
#' results, and \code{xml_grab}, which does, umm, something similar. You should probably
#' ask Jakob about that.
#'
#' There's a vignette, showing the first two functions at work.
