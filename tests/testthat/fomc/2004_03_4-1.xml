The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent.

The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand briskly. Although new hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest continued improvement in the labor market. Although new hiring has been disappointing, other indicators suggest continued improvement in the labor market. Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low. To date, increases in core consumer prices have been muted and inflation expectations remain contained.


The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of susta inable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. The probability of a rise in inflation about equals that of an unwelcome decline in inflation. The Committee recognizes that the stance of monetary policy has been quite accommodative for some time. Nonetheless, with inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can still be patient in removing its policy accommodation.
